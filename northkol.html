        The tiny, outdated eateries that are crammed into the congested alleys and lonely alleyways
        of north Kolkata have become legendary. Anyone in Kolkata will tell you as much, although 
        with a heaping helping of nostalgia.
        These restaurants continue to be places where addaa, is exchanged despite the deteriorating 
        appearance and cramped spaces.

        You must visit one or all of these venerable, vintage establishments to really comprehend 
        why Kolkata, of all the cities in the nation, was included on the hallowed list. 

        <ol>
            <li>
                Golbari:
                This famous restaurant, which is situated in Shyambazar, is just one year away from
                turning 100. Since then, it has been serving the greatest Kosha Mangsho in the area,
                a dish similar to Bhuna Mutton. Although their kosha is somewhat of a cult favourite 
                in Kolkata among foodies, their cutlets and chops are also delicious.

                Recommended Dishes:Mutton Kosha, Mutton Cutlet, Fish Chop

                Address:Shyambazar, 211, Acharya Prafulla Chandra Rd, Fariapukur, Kolkata (Calcutta) 700004 India

            </li>
            <li>
                Mitra Cafe:
                The century old Mitra Cafe is another potential contender in this arena.You can tell as soon as you 
                enter because of the dated yellow and green decor and the unpretentious attitude of the waitresses. 
                People from all over the city line up in front of this particular branch to enjoy their traditional
                cutlets and Mughlai dishes.

                Recommended Dishes:Fish roll, brain chop, mutton kabiraji

                Address:3A, Bhupendra Bose Avenue, Hati Bagan, Shyambazar Kolkata (Calcutta) 700004 India

            </li>
            <li>
                Girish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy :
                Not mentioning the most well-known sweet shop in the neighborhood, which has been open since 1844,
                a food trail through north Kolkata would be lacking. Even though it has gained enormous renown for 
                producing the best sandesh in the city, the shop is still located in the same location. 

                Recommended Dishes:Jalbhara sandesh, monopuli, malai roll, karapak talsash

                Address: 56, Ramdulal Sarkar Street, Hedua Park, Hatibagan
            </li>
            <li>
                Paramount:
                When marketing, advertising, and diversification are necessary for a business to succeed, Paramount
                in Kolkata has defied all the accepted game-changing norms.

                When you learn that Paramount, a more than a century-old store on Bankim Chatterjee Street in the
                heart of Kolkata, only sells sharbat and syrup produced from their own recipes, can you really be 
                that critical of the policy? The entrance's signage informs you as you approach that the store was 
                established in 1918.


                The departed added, with a tinge of pride in his voice, "My father had instilled in us the'mantra'
                of using quality ingredients, and that is what has stood us in good stead all these years."

                Recommended Dishes:Daab Sharbat , Kesar Malai,Passion Fruits

                Address: Bankim Chatterjee Street College Square, Kolkata (Calcutta) 700073 India
            </li>
            <li>
                Indian Coffee House:
                The Indian Coffee House in Kolkata is a beloved "Adda" not just for the local students but also for
                the city's intelligentsia and office workers. It is a setting where concepts are discussed over coffee. 
                The topics discussed here cover practically everything, including campus life, lesson plans, politics,
                business, economics, weddings, sports, movies, music, and future plans. This coffee shop's tables and 
                chairs have taken part in an endless amount of tales and discussions.

                Recommended Dishes: fish fry, chicken cutlet, mutton cutlet, chicken chowmein, fish kabiraji 

                Address: 15, Bankim Chatterjee Street, Near Presidency College, College Street, Kolkata (Calcutta) India
