            The modest kochuri is a name that consistently appears on the list of Bengalis' Favourites. A 
            hing (asafoetida) kochuri is a beloved breakfast food all year round, but it is particularly 
            well-liked in the winter. The kochuri is unique in that it is both a beloved street meal and
            a delicious home-cooked dish when served with aloor torkari or chholar dal. Seasonal 
            koraishuti (green pea) stuffing only heightens its appeal in the winter.
                                       
                                                
            We have a list of locations where you can find phulko kochuri if you're in the mood for one.
            Here is a kochuri trail for the upcoming winter and the remainder of the year.

            Everybody has a favorite local store, but Calcations frequently go to the other ends of the
            city to get their morning kochuri fix. It's interesting to note that some of the most well-liked
            establishments offering the dishes are conveniently close to open spaces where many early-morning
            joggers and walkers congregate.
            Even gluten-averse people will want to pack a thonga to go home when the wafting aroma of kochuris
            cooking meets the nose on those chilly morning walks. Stop at Maharani Tea & Tiffin or Maharaja Snacks
            on Sarat Bose Road if you're at Deshopriya Park or Rabindra Sarobar.
            If you're in the city's central or northern regions and you're craving a small-sized dal kachori or
            club kachori, head to Nasta in Kakurgachi, Haryana, which is located near Dinosaur Park.


                        <img src="kachuri stall.jpg" height="400px">
            While the well-known ones remain prominent, there are several lesser-known kochuri shops located
            throughout the city that are just as popular, and not just with locals. You might not locate a
            signboard for many of these because they are only identified by their owner's name; instead, you
            might find them on Google Maps.

            These locations include Potla'r kochuri on Bagbajar Street, Gadar kochuri next to Hathibagan market,
            Bankim er kochuri in front of the gas station on Harish Mukherjee Road near School Road, and Kanai
            er kochuri in Kidderpore.    

            By allowing you to choose between cholar dal and aloo torkari, Manik er kochuri in the vicinity of
            Jadu Babu Bazar stands out. Shibe and Madan, brothers, run a single store on Hari Ghosh Street close
            to Hatibagan. One serves morning-only crispy khasta kochuris, while the other sells conventional
            kochuri in the evening.

                        <img src="kachuri 3.jpg" height="400px">

        Bengalis and their kochuri have a long-standing love affair. No matter how many new delicacies are introduced
        to the city,
        Calcations will always be patiently awaiting outside a kochuri shop.
